## Features 
* The character has the inverse kinematic feature. Because of this, it has a more natural appearance on slopes or elevations.
* There are structures that can be broken in the game. When you hit them, they explode.
* The enemies in the game patrol a specific route. When they see the character, they run after him. 
* When enemies take damage, the enemy performs an animation in the opposite direction of the damage. At the same time, death animations are shaped according to the main character's hitting style. It has a hitting style from up to down or from right to left.
